            <p>Hex is a board game for two players, it is composed of a grid of 11x11 hexagons. Each player can color an hexagon of their color each turn and the objective is to connect the opposite side of your color. I really like this game because it's impossible to do a draw, one player must win. Another rule is that on the second move, the player 2 can choose to swap color so it's like the player 2 make the first move. You can find more information and the precise rule on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)">wikipedia page of game</a>.</p>

            <p>I made this project in Unity because I like this game engine. Scripts in Unity are write in C#. Generating the board was not too much difficult, the website that you can find in reference is a big help to better understand hexagon and space you have to put between them. Then I added the possibility to color case with the player color. The hard part was to verify if a player is winning or not, each time a player place a new color, it have to check if one side is connected to the opposite side. To do that, I use a simple recursive algorithm that visit all the case without going back on a case already visited. It's a winning case if it reach the other side of the board.</p>

            <p>My implementation is only in local, but I'll maybe make an online version and add AI later. You can get try the game here : <a href="https://nico12354.github.io/HexGame/Web/">Webgl version link</a> and you can find the source code here : <a href="https://github.com/nico12354/HexGame">Github link</a></p>
