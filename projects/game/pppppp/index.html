            <p>This is the first game that I made on PICO8. PICO8 is a fantasy console, it's like a virtual machine for a console that never exist. It's really fun to make game on a VM like that because it have a lot of limitation and that stimulate a lot the imagination and creativity. Also it makes games looks like good old retro game for the graphics, sounds, ect. It has been created by Lexaloffle Games.</p>

            <p>PPPPPP is a demake of VVVVVV on PICO8 that I made. VVVVVV is a 2D platform game released 2010 and made by Terry Cavanagh. The particularity of this game is that we can't jump, the only thing we can do to overcome obstacles is to invert the gravity. It has a really cool visual style inspired by commodore 64 games and the soundtracks is also gorgeous.</p>

            <p>I'm really happy with what I have done with this game. I mean, it's a little game that you can beat in 10 minutes. But I think it's still a short and funny experience. But if you really like a game like PPPPPP you should really try VVVVVV because it's a really good game.</p>

            <p>Also making this game introduce me to lua, which is a really great and simple language. I really like the simple syntax of this language and it fits really well for PICO 8.</p>

            <p>You can find the source code on this link : <a href="https://github.com/nico12354/PICO8_PPPPPP">GitHub</a>. And if you want to try the game, you can play it on the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">lexaloffle website</a> with the following game card :</p>
