            <p>To make this game I used Unity. I didnt need all the power of Unity to do this project, but I still used this one because I wanted to improve my skills with it.</p>

            <p>All the code of the game are in C#. I made the assets my self so the game is not really beautiful. I used the rules from the gameboy version of the game because I didn't wanted to implement special move that we found in recent tetris game.</p>

            <p>I also did a local scoreboard. I just save the 10 best scores in a local file and update it when a new score is archived.</p>

            <p>You can get the source code of the game on this <a href="https://github.com/nico12354/TetrisGame">GitHub Page</a></p>
