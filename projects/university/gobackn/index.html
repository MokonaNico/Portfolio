            <p>The goal of this project was to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Back-N_ARQ">go-Back-N</a> protocol with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion">congestion control</a> of type Reno. These are protocole types that transmit data in a reliable way on an unreliable channel. To simulate the network, we worked on a simulator made by one of our teacher.</p>

            <p>I'm not going to explain in details what is go-Back-N and the congestion control. In short, it's just a way to be sure that the data is well transmited with pipelining (that means that multiple chunk of data can be sent one after the other). To choose the number of data that we want to send, we limit ourselves with a window size. This window's size can be changed by the congestion control to avoid the congestion colapse.</p>

            <p>It was a project by group of 2 students. I can't share the source code because it's a university project.</p>

            <p>The Network simulator was in Java so we implemented the protocol in Java inside the simulator. We also created a bit of code in python to read the data output by the simulator and plot it, we used Mathplotlib for that. It was a bit hard to merge go-Back-N and congestion control but with the help of our notes, we found a way that works pretty well.</p>

            <p>You can see on the image just below a plot of some results that we got from the simulator. It shows the window's size over time :</p>
