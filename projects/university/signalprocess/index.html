            <p>This is a project that I made during last year of bachelor. It was by group of two for the signal processing lecture. This project consist of creating a speaker classification program. </p>


            <p>The first thing to do was to extract features from sample of voices. We extract those features : signal energy, pitch, formants and MFCC. The next step was to build a rule-based system with the features that we extract to differentiate samples of voice from two speaker. The last step was to made a machine learning system and compare it with the rule-based system.</p>

            <p>To make this project we used python with the following libraries : numpy, scipy, scikits.talkbox and sklearn. I can't share the code because this is a university project. </p>
