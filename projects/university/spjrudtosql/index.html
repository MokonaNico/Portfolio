            <p>This is a little project that I had to do for the databases course. The objective of the project is to do an interpreter to translate SPJRUD requests into SQL requests. SPJRUD comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra">relational algebra</a>, S is for Selection, P for Projection, J is for Join, R is Rename, U is Union and D is Division. After the translation, the SQL requests have to be done on a database. It was a project by group of 2 students.</p>

            <p>I can't share the source code because it's a university project.</p>

            <p>We had to implement it in Python. We created an object for each operation in SPJRUD. The parameters for the constructor of each operation were the parameters of the operation themselves. For each object, we looked for the best translation in SQL and implemented it. At the end, we just added the database, it was a simple SQLite db.</p>
