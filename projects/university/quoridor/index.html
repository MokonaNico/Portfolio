            <p>The goal of this project was to implement the board game "Quoridor" into a graphical application in Java. We had to make it player versus player but we also had to create an AI to play against. Another important feature was to create a system to save and load a game. It was also asked to invent/find new features to add to the game, so we chose to add a replay system. At the end of the game, we can now reverse move by move to see how the game has evolved. We also created a 3D view in addition to the 2D view, so  we can play in both versions which is pretty cool.</p>

            <p>It was a group project. We had to work with a teammate, so we split the tasks in two: I was in charge of creating the model (we used a MVC design pattern) and my friend did all the graphics for the game. He also made the save and load system and I created the AI.</p>

            <p>I can't share the source code because it's an academic project but you can see some images of the final result just below and some explanation of the implementation.</p>

            <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
            <p>First we created a little prototype in python to test our ideas and see if they worked. It was a good idea because it didn't take a lot of time and it filtered a lot of "bad implementation design". Right after that I created in Java the base of the game and implemented all the rules based on what we did with the prototype.</p>

            <p>So for the graphical user interface, my friend used JavaFX with the SceneBuilder to create all the different scenes of the game. The 3D scene was easy to implement because JavaFx comes with a lot of features for 3D scenes. My friend did the save/load game by parsing every object into a JSON string and save it into a file. Then for the load process, he just parsed the JSON to Java objects and we were able to return to the game exactly where we saved it.</p>

            <p>I didn't have much time to do the AI so I made a basic one. I implemented the A* pathfinding method to know the shortest path to the end of the board. I made the AI always follow this path, but as well I computed the path for the player. The AI had to compare the number of steps for itself and for the opponent and if the opponent has the advantage, the AI will try to block him with walls. If the AI has the advantage then it will only progress by following the path.</p>
