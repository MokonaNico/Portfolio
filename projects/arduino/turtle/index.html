            <p>I did this project with my girlfriend when we just got the tft led screen of elegoo. We wanted to draw thing on the screen so the first idea that I got was to recreate something like the turtle in Python. So I made a turtle like the one in Python and we tried to draw different shape with this little turtle.</p>

            <p>You can see different picture that we take of what we did with the turtle and the source code plus some explaination are in the implementaiton section.</p>

            <p>Some pictures that we take of the turtle :</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/polygon.jpg"/> 
                <figcaption>The turtle drown different polygons.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/circle.jpg"/> 
                <figcaption>If we say to the turtle to draw a polygon with a lot of sides we make a circle. <br>Here you can see multiple circle of different radius with the same starting point. </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/tree.jpg"/> 
                <figcaption>Here the turtle drown the fractal tree.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/kosh.gif"/> 
                <figcaption>Some iteration of the Kosh curve.</figcaption>

            <p>The first thing that I did was to create the Turtle object, it handle all the drawing stuff and it handle all the movement of the turtle like moving forward/backward, turning, ... With a turtle like this one, you can easily draw shape like polygon and do fractal figure with the recursion. You can see how me and my girlfriend did this in the source code. </p>

            <p>To do this project, you need an elegoo tft lcd screen and an arduino. You can get the library to communicate with the screen on those links : <a href="https://github.com/Erutan409/Elegoo_TFTLCD">Elegoo_TFTLCD</a> & <a href="https://github.com/Erutan409/Elegoo_GFX">Elegoo_GFX</a>. And the source code of the project is here : <a href="https://github.com/nico12354/TurtleArduino">github link</a></p>
