            <p>This is one of my first project on arduino, not exactly the first one but all the other projects' purpose was to test components and understand how they work. It's an implementation of the game Snake using an arduino with a 8x8 led matrix and a joystick for the control.</p>

            <p>Implementing the snake is easy, the only "hard" part is to understand how to make the body of the snake follow the head, but when you get it it's easy to implement. For this project I used the Elegoo's 8x8 matrix led to display the stage of the game. The snake body is made with red dots and the apple is a single red dot blinking. We can't tell the difference between the body and the head of the snake which is an inconvenience but I can't do better with a unicolor led matrix.</p>

            <p>To get the input of the player I used a joystick, that I used to get the 4 directions of the snake. I used a lcd screen to print some information like the current length of the snake and the state of the game.</p>
